## Project Overview
Welcome to our project Game Changer. The idea of our project was to create a product that could intentionally connect players with similar interests, schedules and characteristics to gice the strongest chance to allow lasting frinedships to be made. We wanted to deliver this product by allowing users to input descriptive information, assigning weighted values to the information, and then comparing the values against other users. The system would then display a list of users with the closest total weighted score to the user. These users' profiles would also display their available aliases to enable connection on other media platforms.\
